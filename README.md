# VaccinePredictor

## Project Description
VaccinePredictor aims to forecast the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. Using a dataset with 35 features including demographic information, medical history, and behavioral factors, we predict two probabilities: one for xyz vaccine uptake and one for seasonal vaccine uptake. This multilabel prediction model leverages machine learning techniques to provide probabilistic outputs, evaluated using ROC AUC. The goal is to understand and enhance vaccine adoption through data-driven insights.
